# IchSwag's Setup

Hey! This is my personal gaming PC setup website.  
I built it to show off all my gear — mouse, keyboard, monitor, headset, PC parts — with links if you wanna check or buy the same stuff.

## What it does

- Shows all my setup items in a neat grid  
- Has a dark/light mode toggle because vibes matter  
- Top bar with my YouTube, TikTok, and Discord links  
- The top bar has a cool blur effect when you scroll  
- Works well on phones and desktops

## How to run it

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in any browser  
3. Customize it if you want — swap images, links, or add stuff  
4. Upload it anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, whatever) to share with friends
